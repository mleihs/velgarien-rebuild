## What Is This?

metaverse.center is a multiplayer worldbuilding platform where users create and manage literary simulations &mdash; each a distinct fictional world with its own agents, buildings, locations, events, and political dynamics. The platform ships with five richly detailed flagship worlds, but any user can forge new simulations with custom lore, themes, and entity hierarchies. Players shape their worlds through AI-assisted content generation and compete in **Epochs**: structured PvP campaigns where operatives are deployed, alliances form and fracture, and scoring spans five strategic dimensions.

A **cross-simulation diplomacy layer** connects worlds through embassies, ambassadors carry influence across borders, and "Event Echoes" bleed narrative consequences from one simulation into another. A force-directed **Cartographer's Map** visualizes the entire multiverse &mdash; simulation nodes, diplomatic connections, active game instances, operative trails, and real-time battle feeds.

Every number tells a story. Every story changes a number. Agent aptitudes shape operative success probabilities. Zone stability degrades under sabotage. Embassy effectiveness drops when infiltrators compromise diplomatic channels. The game balance is calibrated through deterministic simulation of hundreds of epoch matches, with statistical analysis driving each tuning pass.

The entire platform is bilingual (English/German), fully themed per-simulation with WCAG 2.1 AA contrast validation, and browsable without authentication via a public-first architecture.

## The Flagship Simulations

The platform ships with five richly detailed seed worlds. Users can create additional simulations with custom lore, themes, and entity data through the Simulation Forge.

| Simulation | Theme | Literary DNA | Aesthetic |
|:-----------|:------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Velgarien** | Brutalist dystopia | Kafka, Zamyatin, Bulgakov, Strugatsky | Dark concrete, surveillance state, Le Corbusier meets Rodchenko |
| **The Gaslit Reach** | Subterranean Gothic | Fallen London, Gormenghast, Mieville | Bioluminescent caverns, amber light, Victorian fungal decay |
| **Station Null** | Deep space horror | Lem (*Solaris*), Watts (*Blindsight*), Tarkovsky | Sterile corridors, impossible geometry, signal corruption |
| **Speranza** | Post-apocalyptic survival | Arc Raiders, collective governance fiction | Warm parchment, golden amber, reclaimed infrastructure |
| **Cite des Dames** | Feminist literary utopia | Christine de Pizan, Bluestocking salons | Illuminated manuscripts, ultramarine & gold, vellum cream |

Each simulation has its own CSS theme preset, lore (~5,000 words of in-world narrative), AI prompt templates, and entity data (agents, buildings, zones, streets). Cite des Dames is the first light-themed simulation; the others use dark palettes.

## Gameplay: The Competitive Layer

### Epoch Lifecycle

```
LOBBY ──► FOUNDATION ──► COMPETITION ──► RECKONING ──► COMPLETED
  │         │                │               │
  │         │                │               └─ Final scoring, archival
  │         │                └─ All operative types, full warfare
  │         └─ Spy + Guardian deployment, zone fortification, +50% RP
  └─ Open join (any user + any sim), draft agents, form teams, add bots
```

### Agent Aptitudes & Draft

Each agent has aptitude scores (3&ndash;9) across all six operative types, with a fixed budget of 36 points per agent. Before a match begins, players draft a subset of their simulation's agents into their roster. Aptitude directly modifies operative success probability: a score of 9 gives +27% success over a score of 3.

### Operative Types

| Type | RP Cost | Effect on Success | Scoring Impact |
|:-----|:--------|:------------------|:---------------|
| **Spy** | 4 | Reveals zone security, guardians, and hidden fortifications | +2 Influence, +1 Diplomatic/success |
| **Guardian** | 4 | Reduces enemy operative success by 6%/unit (cap 15%) | +4 Sovereignty |
| **Saboteur** | 5 | Downgrades random target zone security by 1 tier | -6 Stability to target |
| **Propagandist** | 5 | Creates narrative event in target simulation | +5 Influence, -6 Sovereignty to target |
| **Infiltrator** | 5 | Reduces target embassy effectiveness by 65% for 3 cycles | +3 Influence, -8 Sovereignty to target |
| **Assassin** | 7 | Blocks target ambassador for 3 cycles | -5 Stability to target, -12 Sovereignty to target |

### Five Scoring Dimensions

**Stability** &middot; **Influence** &middot; **Sovereignty** &middot; **Diplomatic** &middot; **Military**

Each dimension aggregates from materialized views (building readiness, zone stability, embassy effectiveness) and operative outcomes. Alliance bonuses (+15% diplomatic per ally), betrayal penalties (-25% diplomatic), and spy intelligence all feed into the final composite score.

### Bot AI

Five personality archetypes &mdash; **Sentinel**, **Warlord**, **Diplomat**, **Strategist**, **Chaos** &mdash; each at three difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard). Bots make fog-of-war-compliant decisions using the same `OperativeService.deploy()` pipeline as human players. Dual-mode chat: instant template-based messages or LLM-generated tactical banter via OpenRouter.

---

## TCG Card System

Every agent and building in the platform is rendered as a collectible card &mdash; a unified `<velg-game-card>` component inspired by Hearthstone, MTG Arena, Marvel Snap, and Balatro. Cards are tactile objects, not flat list items.

### Card Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌─┐                        ┌─┐ │  Stat gems (diamond-rotated)
│ │36│  ┌───────────────────┐ │ 8│ │  Left: power level / capacity
│ └─┘  │                   │ └─┘ │  Right: best aptitude / condition
│      │    CARD ARTWORK   │     │

│      └───────────────────┘     │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────┐│  Name plate with gradient divider

│ └─────────────────────────────┘│
│  ▪7 ▪5 ▪8 ▪4 ▪6 ▪6            │  Aptitude pips (operative-colored)
│  SPY GRD SAB PRP INF ASN      │  or building type / condition badges
│  Profession · Gender           │  Subtitle + capacity bar
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Rarity Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Visual Treatment |
|:-----|:---------|:-----------------|
| **Common** | Standard agent/building | Plain border |
| **Rare** | Has relationships, AI-generated, or embassy | Gradient border (type-colored) |
| **Legendary** | Ambassador, aptitude 9, or embassy in good condition | Animated glow + holographic rainbow shimmer on hover |

### Interactions

- **3D Tilt** &mdash; Mouse-tracking `rotateX/Y` via CSS custom properties (`--mx`, `--my`), 800px perspective, spring-back on leave
- **Light Reflection** &mdash; Radial gradient overlay follows cursor position with `mix-blend-mode: overlay`
- **Holographic Foil** &mdash; Legendary cards only: rainbow shimmer via `color-dodge` blend mode, tracks mouse
- **Card Deal** &mdash; Staggered entrance: `translateY(60px) scale(0.8) rotateZ(8deg)` &rarr; rest, 400ms spring easing, 50ms stagger
- **Idle Sway** &mdash; Micro `translateY` oscillation (1px, 4s cycle), phased per card index
- **Four Sizes** &mdash; `xs` (80&times;112), `sm` (120&times;168), `md` (200&times;280), `lg` (280&times;392) &mdash; 5:7 TCG aspect ratio

### Draft Phase &mdash; "The Hand"

During pre-match drafting, the DraftRosterPanel presents available agents as a fanned hand of cards. Players select which agents to deploy into their match roster, seeing aptitude pips and rarity at a glance. Drafted cards receive a "DEPLOYED" stamp and dim. The card system makes agent composition feel like deckbuilding.

---

## Game Balance & Intelligence Gathering

Balance is calibrated through deterministic simulation, not intuition.

### Methodology

The epoch simulation library (`scripts/epoch_sim_lib.py`) runs 50&ndash;200 complete epoch matches per tuning pass, varying player counts (2&ndash;5), strategy distributions, and alliance configurations. Each run produces win rates, operative success distributions, and scoring breakdowns.

### Balance Evolution

| Version | Key Changes | Result |
|:--------|:------------|:-------|
| **v2.0** | Initial release | Guardian-heavy defense dominated (~100% win rate for `ci_defensive`) |
| **v2.1** | Guardian 0.10&rarr;0.08/unit, cap 0.25&rarr;0.20, alliance +15%, betrayal -25% | `ci_defensive` dropped to ~64% |
| **v2.2** | Guardian 0.08&rarr;0.06, cap 0.20&rarr;0.15, cost 3&rarr;4 RP; Infiltrator/Assassin rework; RP 10&rarr;12/cycle | Nash equilibrium convergence, operative success rates ~55-58% |
| **v2.3** | Agent aptitudes (3-9 scores), draft phase, formula `aptitude*0.03` | 18pp success swing between best/worst agents; strategic agent selection matters |
| **v2.4** | Foundation redesign: spy+guardian+fortification; open epoch participation | Hidden defensive layer, early intel, any user can join any epoch |
| **v2.5** | The Chronicle (AI newspaper) + Agent Memory & Reflection (pgvector) | Living world systems: worlds narrate themselves, agents remember |

### Intelligence Report

The How-to-Play page includes an interactive **Intelligence Report** built with Apache ECharts:
- **Radar chart** &mdash; simulation profile comparisons across scoring dimensions
- **Heatmap** &mdash; head-to-head 2-player duel win rates
- **Grouped bar** &mdash; strategy tiers with Wilson 95% confidence interval whiskers
- **Multi-line** &mdash; win rate evolution by player count

```

### Key Patterns

- **Public-First Architecture** &mdash; All simulation data is browsable without authentication. Frontend API services route to `/api/v1/public/*` (anon RLS policies) for unauthenticated visitors and authenticated non-members alike.
- **Hybrid Supabase** &mdash; Frontend talks to Supabase directly for Auth, Storage, and Realtime. Business logic routes through FastAPI, which forwards the user's JWT so RLS is always enforced.
- **Defense in Depth** &mdash; FastAPI `Depends()` validates roles (layer 1), Supabase RLS validates row-level access (layer 2). Neither layer trusts the other.
- **Per-Simulation Theming** &mdash; CSS custom properties cascade through shadow DOM. Each simulation gets its own theme preset, all validated against WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios.
- **Structured Logging** &mdash; structlog on top of stdlib logging. JSON output in production, console renderer locally. Request context (user_id, request_id, method, path) injected via middleware. All mutations log with structured `extra={}` fields for observability.
- **Game Instance Isolation** &mdash; When an epoch starts, participating simulations are atomically cloned into balanced game instances. Templates remain untouched. Clones are archived on completion, deleted on cancellation.
