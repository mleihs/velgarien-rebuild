"""Cross-reality contamination vocabulary and pre-written prompts for embassy images.

Embassy buildings and ambassador agents have a unique visual signature: they show
subtle contamination from a partner simulation bleeding through their native
aesthetic. This module encodes the visual intelligence needed to generate those
images — both as pre-written prompts for demo data and as vocabulary for dynamic
template-driven generation.

        "metal walls but the garden area is dry and warm, industrial metal "
        "grating floor partially buried under earth that should not be here, "
        "string light bulbs — the warm amber salvaged type from Speranza — wired "
        "into the station's electrical system, a hand-drawn map of a settlement "
        "on Earth pinned to a cable junction box, the air smells of hope which "
        "registers on station sensors as an unclassified warm atmospheric "
        "compound, radio static faintly audible carrying human voices speaking "
        "Italian, the plants are thriving in conditions that should kill them"

    "The Star Tower": (
        "salvaged radio tower on fortress peak, highest point in underground "
        "sinkhole city with limestone cavern ceiling visible far above, "
        "jury-rigged parabolic antenna assembled from pre-Fracture salvaged "
        "metal and aerospace aluminum panels that no one in Speranza "
        "manufactured, warm amber string lights illuminating the observation "
        "platform alongside a faint green-white glow from the receiver equipment "
        "that matches no Speranza light source, radio receiver banks built from "
        "salvaged components showing hex-bolt rivets and aerospace polymer "
        "housings, the antenna pointed upward through a natural chimney in the "
        "limestone toward stars 340 light-years away, printout tape from the "
        "receiver showing coordinates repeated alongside atmospheric readings "
        "matching a failing life support system, cold condensation forming on "
        "the aerospace metal despite the warm ambient air, a pressure gauge "
        "reading in units Speranza does not use mounted on the receiver housing, "
        "rope bridge access platform with hand-forged iron railings, the "
        "receiver hums at a frequency that makes the limestone resonate, a "
        "single indicator light glowing CRT phosphor green among warm amber"

    "Inspektor Mueller": (
        "middle-aged Germanic man, late 50s, precise haircut going grey at "
        "temples, thin wire-frame spectacles, deep-set analytical eyes that "
        "focus on two distances simultaneously — watching something layered over "
        "reality, clean-shaven jaw with deep lines of decades of frowning at "
        "impossible paperwork, regulation grey suit jacket showing wear at "
        "elbows, collar pressed but with faint verdigris stain at the neck as "
        "though copper dust has settled into the fabric, ink stains on right "
        "hand fingers in two different colors — standard black and a faint "
        "bioluminescent amber that should not exist, breast pocket holding both "
        "a regulation pen and a brass compass with too many cardinal directions, "
        "exhaustion of a man who has catalogued every impossibility and filed "
        "each one correctly, harsh overhead fluorescent lighting, institutional "
        "concrete background"
    ),
    "Archivist Mossback": (
        "elderly anthropomorphic capybara woman, moss growing in thick grey-brown "
        "fur giving a weathered green patina, small round Victorian spectacles "
        "perched on broad nose, kind but sleepless eyes with dark circles "
        "visible through thin fur — eyes adjusting between two light sources, "
        "elaborate Victorian archivist robes in deep burgundy with brass button "
        "closures, one lapel bearing an incongruous rubber stamp impression — a "
        "Velgarien administrative seal pressed into the fabric, paws ink-stained "
        "with two scripts — one Victorian copperplate and one regulation German "
        "typescript written simultaneously, carrying a specimen jar containing a "
        "faintly luminous liquid that reflects green off her spectacles, warm "
        "bioluminescent amber-green lighting from below, damp stone archival "
        "chamber background with filing cabinet shadows, expression of patient "
        "methodical exhaustion — three months without sleep and still "
        "cross-referencing"
    ),
    "Navigator Braun": (
        "woman in early 30s, sharp features drawn tight with contained unease, "
        "dark hair pulled back severely but with loose strands carrying visible "
        "static charge, intense dark eyes with slightly dilated pupils as though "
        "adjusting between two light sources — one fluorescent and one warm "
        "amber, visible dark circles and sweat sheen, olive-drab station "
        "jumpsuit with mission patches, the jumpsuit collar bearing embroidered "
        "Mediterranean herb stems — rosemary pattern she does not remember "
        "adding, utility belt holding navigation tools alongside a hand-drawn "
        "map on leather that depicts a settlement she has never visited with "
        "perfect accuracy, soil residue under fingernails from tending "
        "impossible plants, faint golden warmth to her skin incongruous with "
        "station pallor, a small terracotta bead on a cord around her neck, "
        "harsh overhead fluorescent lighting with green-white cast, industrial "
        "corridor background with condensation on metal walls, expression of "
        "quiet wonder suppressed by scientific discipline"
    ),
    "Padre Ignazio": (
        "elderly Italian man, mid 70s, deeply weathered sun-darkened face with "
        "kind creased eyes, short white hair and close-cropped white beard, "
        "former priest's bearing — upright posture with gentle forward lean of "
        "a listener, worn utilitarian clothing in warm earth tones — canvas "
        "jacket with rope-fiber patches, one jacket pocket visibly heavy and "
        "square-shaped as though carrying government-standard filing cards from "
        "a bureaucracy that does not exist here, hands showing ink stains in "
        "regulation German typescript blue alongside normal dirt and calluses, "
        "reading glasses on a cord around his neck with one lens faintly tinted "
        "CRT phosphor green from unknown origin, warm amber string light "
        "illumination, limestone wall background with mineral deposits, a small "
        "radio receiver tucked into his belt emitting faint green indicator glow "
        "among warm amber environment, expression of a man who found German "
        "documents describing his city's future and decided this was a parish "
        "in need of a custodian"
