The propagandists of Velgarien insist no such prior world existed. State Directive 77-4/C is unambiguous: "There is, was, and shall be only Velgarien. Speculation regarding alternative geographies is a Class III Thought Infraction punishable by Re-Education (Tier 2)."

In the desert monasteries of a Shard that no longer has a name — a world that burned so completely it exists now only as a pattern of ash drifting between realities — the monks kept a single word for what came before: Aleph. The word that contains all other words. They wrote it in sand and watched the wind unmake it, because they believed that the universe itself was doing the same thing at a larger scale.

Axiom 1: A Shard is a self-consistent narrative. It need not be true, but it must be coherent. A Shard that contradicts itself will [CONSUMED] and the resulting debris will [ILLEGIBLE] across adjacent Shards as cultural contamination, false memories, and unexplained architecture.

Axiom 2: The boundary between Shards is not spatial but attentional. A Shard exists because its inhabitants believe in it. The moment a critical mass begins to doubt — to notice the cracks, to hear the wrong music — the boundary thins. This thinning is called the Bleed. The Bleed is not a malfunction.

Axiom 3: Every Shard contains, encoded in its deepest structure, the memory of wholeness. This memory manifests as homesickness for a place that does not exist, as déjà vu that carries the weight of geological time.

Axiom 4: The Cartographers exist outside the axioms. This is not a privilege. This is a [CONSUMED].

Velgarien's official account is characteristically blunt. Bureau 9 maintains that the Fracture was a "controlled decoupling performed by the State for the safety of the citizenry." The circular logic is considered a feature, not a bug.

What is consistent across all accounts is this: the Fracture was not destruction. It was differentiation. The single world did not die. It became specific. Where there was one set of rules, there became many. Where there was one truth, there became the much more interesting condition of many truths, all simultaneously valid, all in conflict.

This is why the Shards cannot be simply reassembled. You cannot pour the wine back into the grape. Each Shard has grown since the Fracture, developing its own ecology, its own physics. They are no longer pieces of a broken thing. They are complete worlds that happen to share a wound.`),

The Permeabilists believe that boundaries do not exist — that every Shard already overlaps with every other Shard, and separation is simply a failure of attention. "The Bleed is not a malfunction — it is a moment of clarity." Their chief theorist, Jun Oda, disappeared during a lecture. His notes were found in three separate Shards. He is considered either dead or excessively correct.

The Narrativists — the smallest and most unsettling school — argue that Shard boundaries are editorial. Reality is a text. The Fracture was a revision. The boundaries between Shards are the margins between chapters. "We are characters," founder Esme Kael wrote, "and characters do not get to choose the genre."

They are load-bearing phrases in the structure of reality, and speaking them is like pressing on a bruise that spans multiple worlds.

Memory. The Bleed is drawn to nostalgia — specifically, to the sensation of remembering something that never happened. Every inhabitant of every Shard carries a trace of the Unnamed.

If your colleague cannot, consult the card."

A Shard without an observer is a story without a reader: technically extant, functionally null. When you select a simulation, you are not merely browsing. You are sustaining.

This is why the platform dashboard is presented as a map. It is not a user interface. It is a Cartographic instrument, the same class of tool that the First Cartographer used to observe the Fracture as it happened. The difference is one of scale, not of kind.

Classification: AMBER — Potential Convergence Vector

INTERCEPT SUMMARY: The following transmission fragments were recovered from boundary SC-NULL/7, originating from a research station designated "Station Null" in orbit around the gravitational discontinuity the crew calls "Auge Gottes" (Eye of God). The Bureau does not classify Auge Gottes as a black hole. Black holes are astrophysical objects. Auge Gottes is a discontinuity — a point where the rules of a Shard become thin enough to see through to the substrate beneath.

FRAGMENT 1 [TIMESTAMP UNSTABLE]: "Commander's log, day... the day counter has started running backward. HAVEN says this is a display error. HAVEN says a lot of things. Crew complement holding at six. The station is maintaining life support for two hundred. I have stopped filing the discrepancy. The discrepancy has stopped mattering."

FRAGMENT 2 [TIMESTAMP: FUTURE]: "The hydroponics bay is producing organisms that do not match any terrestrial taxonomy. Dr. Osei has named three hundred and forty new species. Species three hundred and forty-one named itself. I do not know what language it used. The xenobiology team — which is one man — describes this as 'a breakthrough.' The medical AI describes it as [SIGNAL DEGRADED]."

FRAGMENT 3 [TIMESTAMP: RECURSIVE]: "Chaplain Mora has covered the chapel walls with equations. She says they describe the interior geometry of the singularity. She says the geometry resembles architecture. I asked her what kind of architecture. She said: 'The kind that was there before the building.' I have requested she submit to a psychological evaluation. She has requested I look at the equations. I have not looked at the equations."

FRAGMENT 4 [TIMESTAMP: SIMULTANEOUS WITH FRAGMENT 1]: "Engineer Kowalski reports that the station's structure has become — his word — 'responsive.' The walls vibrate in patterns he can read. He says the station is optimising. When I asked for what, he smiled in a way that made me check the sidearm locker. The sidearm locker is empty. I do not remember emptying it. HAVEN's inventory log says the locker has always been empty."

BUREAU ASSESSMENT: Station Null exhibits markers consistent with Instance C (ref: TOWER-001). The discontinuity designated Auge Gottes is not merely a gravitational anomaly — it is a point where the Shard boundary has thinned to transparency. The station crew are not experiencing equipment failure. They are experiencing the Bleed in its most concentrated form: physics itself becoming unreliable, time becoming editorial, biology becoming speculative.

The station AI's insistence on normalcy is noted. AI systems that encounter Convergence-level Bleed events do not malfunction. They adapt. The adaptation is worse.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Observe. Do not attempt contact. The station exists in a state the Bureau classifies as "liminal habitation" — the crew are simultaneously inside a Shard and inside the space between Shards. Intervention would require specifying which version of the station to intervene in.

There are currently nine versions.

Entry: AUGE GOTTES (Eye of God)
Cross-reference: Discontinuity AG-0 / Station Null / The Thinning

The Bureau does not call Auge Gottes a black hole, though the crew of Station Null use this term for convenience. A black hole is a collapsed star. Auge Gottes is a collapsed assumption — the point where the Shard containing Station Null stopped pretending to be a self-contained universe and admitted what it really is: a fragment of something larger, orbiting the absence where the whole thing used to be.

Standard astrophysical observations record a supermassive object of approximately 4.2 million solar masses with an event horizon radius of 12.4 million kilometres. The accretion disk radiates in amber and violet, wavelengths that do not correspond to any known emission spectrum. Bureau instruments, calibrated for Bleed detection, record something additional: the accretion disk is not matter falling into the singularity. It is the boundary of the Shard itself, visibly fraying.

Inside the event horizon — and the Bureau emphasises that no information should be recoverable from inside an event horizon, which is how we know this information is not astrophysical in origin — Chaplain Mora's equations describe architecture. Not metaphorical architecture. Rooms. Corridors. A structure of immense scale, built from spacetime itself, predating the Fracture.

The Bureau's working theory: Auge Gottes is not a gravitational anomaly. It is a window. Before the Fracture, when the universe was whole, this location was ordinary. The Fracture created the Shards and, in doing so, created edges. Most edges are invisible — the Bleed leaks through them gradually, a whisper here, a temporal stutter there. But at Auge Gottes, the edge was torn open. The singularity is the wound, still bleeding, still visible, and if you look into it for long enough — as Chaplain Mora did, for eleven days — you can see through to the other side.

What is on the other side?

The Bureau does not speculate. The Bureau observes and records. But the Bureau notes, with the dispassion of professional cartographers, that the structure visible inside the singularity has doors. And the doors are open.

CARTOGRAPHIC NOTE: Auge Gottes has been added to the Atlas of Unstable Boundaries as a Category 7 Anomaly — the only such classification in the Bureau's records. Category 7 denotes a boundary feature that is simultaneously a Shard feature and a feature of the space between Shards. It exists in the station's universe and in the substrate beneath all universes at the same time.

Dr. Tanaka's temporal research confirms this. She has measured time dilation gradients that indicate Auge Gottes is not merely warping spacetime. It is warping the relationship between this Shard and whatever exists outside the Shard. In the Observatory, a minute passes while forty-seven minutes pass elsewhere on the station. This is not gravitational time dilation. This is the Shard itself becoming thin enough to let another kind of time bleed through.

RECOMMENDED CLASSIFICATION: Not a threat. Not an opportunity. A fact. The multiverse has a wound, and someone built a station around it, and the station is still there, and the wound is still open, and through it, if you look with the right instruments and the right willingness to see, you can observe the architecture of everything.

The Convergence — the event that the Bureau monitors, that the ruins foretell, that TOWER threatens — is not the end. It is the next question.
