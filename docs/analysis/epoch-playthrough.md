# Epoch Playthrough: Bug Fix Verification

> Simulated on 2026-02-28 (local API)
> Epoch ID: `99e345fe-20b3-466a-8357-326aaf912550`

## Context

Following the initial Shadow War playthrough, multiple bugs were discovered and fixed:

### Bugs Fixed

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| Guardians had zero effect | Query required `target_zone_id` but guardians have none; also filtered by zone instead of simulation | Count all active guardians in target simulation regardless of zone |
| "medium" security level missing | `clone_simulations_for_epoch()` normalizes to "medium" but `SECURITY_LEVEL_MAP` didn't have it | Added `"medium": 5.5` to the map |
| Scoring always returned empty | No UPDATE RLS policy on `epoch_scores` → composite_score writes failed silently | Migration 038: UPDATE policy on epoch_scores |
| Materialized views stale | Game instances are freshly cloned — MVs had no data for them | Call `refresh_all_game_metrics()` RPC before computing |
| MV column name wrong | `scoring_service.py` used `zone_stability` but MV column is `stability` | Fixed to `stability` with float cast |
| Embassy MV query wrong | Scored by `simulation_id` but MV has `simulation_a_id`/`simulation_b_id` | Fixed to use `or_()` with both columns |
| Embassy count query wrong | Scored by `source_simulation_id` but embassies table has `simulation_a_id` | Fixed column names |
| Audit log RLS failures | Platform-level audit calls (simulation_id=NULL) failed on RLS | Wrapped in try/except across all competitive routers |
| Battle log RLS failures | Same issue for battle_log inserts | Wrapped in try/except with debug logging |
| Score router lint violation | Bare `except: pass` detected by ruff | Added debug logger message |

## Players

| Player | Simulation | Guardians | Strategy |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| P1 | Velgarien (dystopian) | 2 | Heavy defense + targeted strikes |
| P2 | The Gaslit Reach (fantasy) | 1 | Light defense + aggressive offense |

## Game Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Cycle interval | 2 hours |
| RP per cycle | 25 (37 in Foundation with +50% bonus) |
| RP cap | 75 |
| Duration | 7 days |
| Score weights | Default (stab=25, inf=20, sov=20, dipl=15, mil=20) |

## Verification Results

### Guardian Effect ✓

| Target | Guardians | Avg Success Probability | Missions |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| Velgarien | 2 | **0.050** (floor) | 3 |
| The Gaslit Reach | 1 | **0.147** | 3 |

The −0.20 per guardian penalty is clearly visible. With 2 guardians, all attacks on Velgarien are floored at 0.05 (5%). With 1 guardian, Gaslit Reach attacks average 14.7%.

### Scoring ✓

| Dimension | Velgarien | The Gaslit Reach | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Stability | 19.5 | 16.9 | From zone MV after refresh |
| Influence | 0.0 | 0.0 | No bleed echoes in game |
| Sovereignty | 100.0 | 100.0 | No bleed events |
| Diplomatic | 5.6 | 5.6 | Embassy count × 0.5 × 10 |
| Military | -3.0 → 5.0 | -3.0 → -6.0 | Success +2/+5, detection −3 |
| **Composite** | **0.0 → 80.0** | **-3.36 → -3.36** | Weighted + normalized |

Composite scores compute correctly. V's saboteur success in cycle 2 gave +5 military, pushing composite to 80.0.

### Mission Outcomes ✓

| Outcome | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Success | 1 |
| Detected | 3 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Active (guardians) | 3 |

Mixed outcomes confirm probabilistic resolution works. All 3 guardians remain active (permanent).

### RP Economy ✓

| Event | V RP | GR RP |
|-------|------|-------|
| Foundation bonus (25 × 1.5) | 37 | 37 |
| After guardians (−3 each) | 31 | 34 |
| After cycle 1 ops | 23 | 27 |
| After cycle resolve (+25) | 48 | 52 |

### Phase Transitions ✓

```
lobby → foundation → competition → reckoning → completed
```

All transitions executed successfully.

## Key Learnings

1. **Guardians are essential** — 2 guardians reduce all incoming attack probabilities to the 5% floor. The +20% detection per guardian stacks aggressively.
2. **Security level normalization works** — clone function distributes zones as 1×high, 2×medium, 1×low. The `"medium"` key in `SECURITY_LEVEL_MAP` now maps correctly to 5.5.
3. **MV refresh is critical** — freshly cloned game instances have no materialized view data. The `refresh_all_game_metrics()` RPC must run before scoring.
4. **Column naming consistency matters** — embassies use `simulation_a_id`/`simulation_b_id`, not `source_`/`target_`. MVs use `stability`, not `zone_stability`. These mismatches caused 500 errors.
5. **Audit log RLS limitation** — platform-level actions (no `simulation_id`) can't write to `audit_log` due to RLS policy requiring simulation membership. All such calls are wrapped in try/except.
