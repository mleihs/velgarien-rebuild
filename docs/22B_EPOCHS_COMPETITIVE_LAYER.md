# 22 - Epochs & Competitive Layer

**Version:** 1.6
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Change v1.6:** Epoch Cycle Email Notifications — Migration 044: `notification_preferences` table + `get_user_emails_batch()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC. CycleNotificationService (recipient resolution, fog-of-war player briefings, Resend API). 3 email types: cycle briefing, phase change, epoch completed (bilingual EN/DE). 2 new API endpoints (GET/POST `/users/me/notification-preferences`). Frontend: NotificationsSettingsPanel in settings view.
**Change v1.5:** Bot Players — AI-controlled opponents for solo/low-player epochs. Migration 041: `bot_players` + `bot_decision_log` tables, `is_bot`/`bot_player_id` on `epoch_participants`. 5 personality archetypes (Sentinel/Warlord/Diplomat/Strategist/Chaos) × 3 difficulty levels. Backend: BotService (cycle orchestrator), BotGameState (fog-of-war compliant), BotPersonality (5 implementations), BotChatService (dual-mode: template + LLM). Frontend: BotConfigPanel (collectible card deck builder UI), bot indicators in leaderboard/battle log/chat/ready panel, AI Settings bot chat controls.
**Change v1.4:** Balance patch v2.2 — guardian penalty 0.08→0.06/unit (cap 0.15), guardian cost 3→4 RP, infiltrator rework (cost 6→5, embassy reduction 50%→65%, +3 influence/success, sovereignty −6→−8, score 5→6), assassin cost 8→7 + stability −4→−5 + sovereignty −10→−12, saboteur stability −5→−6, propagandist sovereignty −5→−6, detection penalty 2→3, RP economy 10→12/cycle + cap 30→40, counter-intel sweep 3→4 RP.
**Change v1.3:** Balance patch v2.1 — guardian penalty 0.20→0.08/unit (cap 0.20), spy intel reveal (zone security + guardian count to battle log), saboteur zone downgrade (security −1 tier), scoring rebalance (propagandist +3→+5, detection −3→−2, spy influence +1/+2, guardian sovereignty +4), betrayal −20%→−25%, alliance 10%→15%. Cartographer's Map: game instance visualization (phase rings, health arcs, sparklines, operative trails, battle feed, leaderboard panel, minimap, 30s refresh).
**Change v1.2:** EpochCommandCenter decomposed from monolithic 3364-line file into orchestrator (1934 lines) + 5 child components: EpochOpsBoard (ops board + COMMS sidebar), EpochOverviewTab, EpochOperationsTab, EpochAlliancesTab, EpochLobbyActions. Data flows via Lit properties, mutations via CustomEvent bubbling. ~60 hardcoded hex colors replaced with CSS custom property tokens across all epoch components.

## Overview

Epochs are time-limited competitive seasons where simulation owners become active players competing for multiverse dominance. During an Epoch, every worldbuilding decision — staffing buildings, maintaining embassies, managing events — has direct scoring consequences. Simulations deploy covert operatives through embassies to sabotage rivals, gather intelligence, and spread propaganda, while defending their own worlds from infiltration.

Outside of Epochs, the simulation economy (staffing, zone stability, diplomacy, bleed) runs as PvE infrastructure. Epochs activate the PvP competitive layer on top of this foundation.

### Lore Context

> "The Cartographers observed. They mapped. They recorded. But they never intervened — until the Convergence. When the walls between Shards thinned beyond safe limits, the Bureau declared an Epoch: a controlled collision of realities. The Shards would compete. The strongest narrative would persist. The weakest would fade. This was not cruelty. This was triage."

Epochs represent moments when the multiverse forces its simulations into direct competition. The Bleed intensifies, embassies become espionage channels, and the careful infrastructure each simulation owner has built is tested under fire.

## How It Works

### Epoch Lifecycle

```
LOBBY ──→ FOUNDATION ──→ COMPETITION ──→ RECKONING ──→ COMPLETED
          (first ~20%)    (middle ~65%)    (final ~15%)
```

1. **Lobby** — Epoch created, simulations join, teams form. No game mechanics active.
2. **Foundation** — +50% RP income. Build infrastructure, staff buildings, establish embassies. No offensive operatives allowed (guardians OK).
3. **Competition** — Full mechanics. All 6 operative types available. Alliances locked. Scores snapshot each cycle.
4. **Reckoning** — Bleed permeability doubled, thresholds reduced by 2, cascade depth +1. Dramatic escalation.
5. **Completed** — Final scores computed, winner declared, operatives recalled.

### Resonance Points (RP)

RP is the action economy currency. Each simulation receives RP at the start of each cycle.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| RP per cycle | 12 | Base allocation (foundation: 18) |
| RP cap | 40 | Maximum stored RP — excess is lost |
| Cycle interval | 8 hours | Time between cycle resolutions |

**RP costs:**

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Deploy Spy | 3 RP |
| Deploy Guardian | 4 RP |
| Deploy Propagandist | 4 RP |
| Deploy Saboteur | 5 RP |
| Deploy Infiltrator | 5 RP |
| Deploy Assassin | 7 RP |
| Counter-intelligence sweep | 4 RP |

### Operative Types

| Type | Cost | Deploy Time | Duration | Effect |
|------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Spy** | 3 RP | Instant | 3 cycles | Reveals target zone security levels and guardian count (intel report in battle log). +2 Influence, +1 Diplomatic, −2 Sovereignty. |
| **Saboteur** | 5 RP | 1 cycle | Single action | Downgrades random zone security −1 tier + building condition −1. −6 Stability, −8 Sovereignty. |
| **Propagandist** | 4 RP | 1 cycle | 2 cycles | Generates a destabilizing event (impact 6-8) in target zone |
| **Assassin** | 7 RP | 2 cycles | Single action | Wounds target agent — reduces relationships by 2, removes ambassador status for 3 cycles |
| **Guardian** | 4 RP | Instant | Permanent | −6% enemy success per guardian (max −15%). Deploys to OWN simulation only. |
| **Infiltrator** | 5 RP | 2 cycles | 3 cycles | Reduces target embassy effectiveness by 65%. +3 Influence per success. |

### Success Probability

```
base_probability = 0.55
+ operative_qualification × 0.05  (0-10 scale → +0 to +0.50)
- target_zone_security × 0.05    (mapped 0-10 → -0 to -0.50)
- min(0.15, guardian_presence × 0.06)  (−0.06 each, cap 0.15)
+ embassy_effectiveness × 0.15   (0-1 → +0 to +0.15)

Final: clamped to [0.05, 0.95]
```

**Failure outcomes:**
- **Undetected failure** — Mission fails silently. Operative returns. No consequences.
- **Detected failure** (probability: 1 - success_probability) — Operative captured (removed for epoch). Diplomatic Incident event in both simulations (impact 7). Embassy effectiveness -0.3 for 3 cycles. Attacker identity revealed. −3 Sovereignty per detection.

### Scoring — 5 Dimensions

| Dimension | What it rewards | Default Weight | Title |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Stability** | Keeping simulation healthy (avg zone stability) | 25% | "The Unshaken" |
| **Influence** | Shaping other worlds via bleed echoes | 20% | "The Resonant" |
| **Sovereignty** | Resisting foreign influence | 20% | "The Sovereign" |
| **Diplomatic** | Embassy network + alliances | 15% | "The Architect" |
| **Military** | Successful covert operations | 20% | "The Shadow" |

**Composite score** = weighted sum of normalized dimensions. Each dimension is rescaled 0–100 relative to the highest scorer in that dimension. Configurable weights via Epoch Creation Wizard presets: Balanced / Builder / Warmonger / Diplomat.

**Team scoring** = sum of member scores + 5% alliance bonus per active member.

### Alliances & Betrayal

- Teams form during lobby/foundation. Max team size configurable (default 3).
- Alliances lock when competition phase begins (no new teams).
- If `allow_betrayal = true`: allied simulations can covertly attack each other.
  - **Detected betrayal** → alliance immediately dissolves, betrayer gets -25% Diplomatic Score.
  - **Undetected betrayal** → normal operative effects, alliance intact.

### Embassy Requirement

Embassies are the **only channel** for deploying operatives. You cannot attack a simulation without an active embassy connection.

**Strategic implications:**
- Embassies enable both diplomacy (scoring) AND warfare (operatives)
- Dissolving an embassy immediately recalls all your operatives through that channel
- An enemy can dissolve their embassy to cut off your operative pipeline
- But dissolving also kills your own offensive capability and diplomatic score

## User Interface

### Epoch Command Center (`/epoch`)

Platform-level route accessible to all authenticated users. Five tabs:

1. **Overview** — Epoch status banner (name, phase, day counter, next cycle countdown, RP counter), quick actions panel
2. **Leaderboard** — Sortable table with rank, simulation name, composite score, per-dimension bars, team affiliation
3. **Operations** — Your active operatives (status, remaining cycles), detected threats, deploy button
4. **Battle Log** — Chronological narrative feed of competitive events (filterable by type)
5. **Alliances** — Your team, invite/leave controls

**Lobby view** (no active epoch): Past epochs list + Create Epoch button (owners only).

**Design:** Military command console aesthetic. Dark background (gray-950), green (#4ade80) accent for active elements, amber (#f59e0b) for RP/warnings. Monospace readouts for stats. Scan-line texture overlay.

### Epoch Creation Wizard

3-step modal wizard:

1. **Parameters** — Name, duration (3-60 days), cycle interval (2-24 hours), phase percentages (foundation/reckoning split with computed competition phase)
2. **Economy** — RP per cycle, RP cap, max team size, allow betrayal toggle
3. **Doctrine** — 5 score weight sliders (must sum to 100%) with presets: Balanced (25/20/20/15/20), Builder (40/15/15/10/20), Warmonger (15/15/15/15/40), Diplomat (15/20/20/30/15)

### Deploy Operative Modal

3-step tactical dossier wizard:

1. **Asset** — Select agent from your simulation. Shows dossier card (portrait, professions, character excerpt). Warning about leaving building post.
2. **Mission** — Choose operative type (6 cards with cost/duration/effect). Select embassy route. Guardian special case (deploys to own simulation, no embassy needed).
3. **Target** — Select target zone/building/agent based on mission type. SVG targeting ring shows success probability with factor breakdown. Confirmation summary with RP cost.

**Design:** Tactical dossier aesthetic. Amber (#f59e0b) accent, scan-line textures, CLASSIFIED watermark, targeting ring SVG for success probability visualization.

## Bot Players (Migration 041)

Bot players are AI-controlled opponents that allow solo or low-player-count epoch gameplay. Users create reusable "bot presets" — configurable AI personalities that can be shuffled into any epoch. Bots execute synchronously during cycle resolution with full game mechanic compliance (same RP economy, operative constraints, success probability calculations as human players).

### Design Principles

1. **No LLM for tactical decisions** — Deterministic/probabilistic engine with personality-based heuristics. Fast (~50ms per bot per cycle), predictable, auditable, zero API costs for decisions.
2. **LLM for optional chat flavor** — Dual-mode: template-based (free, instant, default) or LLM-generated (rich personality-flavored messages via OpenRouter). Configurable per-simulation in AI Settings.
3. **Fog-of-war compliance** — `BotGameState` builds state from the same queries a human player would see. Spy intel only available if the bot actually deployed successful spies.
4. **Zero code duplication** — Bots call `OperativeService.deploy()` and `OperativeService.spend_rp()` directly. Same validation, same constraints, same success probability.
5. **Admin supabase for writes** — Bots are system-level actors. Using admin client bypasses RLS (no fake JWT sessions per bot).
6. **Reusable presets** — Users create bot presets once, deploy them to any epoch. Like building a "deck of opponents."

| Intel usage | Ignores spy reports | Uses detected ops | Full optimal analysis |
| Target quality | Random target | Decent selection | Optimal (vulnerability scoring) |
| Alliance timing | Random | Foundation phase | Optimal based on standings |
| Threat adaptation | None | Reacts to attacks | Proactive counter-strategy |
| Success threshold | Deploys at any % | Skips < 20% | Skips < 35% (cost-effective only) |

### Bot Execution Flow

During `resolve_cycle()`, after RP grant + mission resolution, before scoring:

```
1. Get all bot participants for the epoch
2. For each bot:
   a. Build BotGameState (fog-of-war compliant — same data as human)
   b. Create personality instance (factory pattern)
   c. Execute decision pipeline:
      - allocate_rp(state) → RP distribution per operative type
      - apply_difficulty_waste() → Easy: 30% random waste
      - select_targets(state, allocation) → deployment plans
      - filter_by_success_threshold() → skip low-probability missions
      - manage_alliances(state) → form/maintain/betray decisions
   d. Execute decisions via OperativeService (same as human)
   e. Log decisions to bot_decision_log (audit trail)
   f. Generate 0-2 chat messages (template or LLM)
   g. Set cycle_ready = TRUE
```

### Bot Chat (Dual Mode)

**Template Mode (Default):** Personality-specific template pools with contextual variable substitution. ~150 templates (5 personalities × 8 contexts × 3-5 variants). Zero API cost, ~0ms latency.

Contexts: idle, attacked, winning, losing, ally_joined, ally_betrayed, deployed, phase_change.

**LLM Mode (Optional):** When `bot_chat_mode = 'llm'` in AI Settings, messages generated via OpenRouter using `model_bot_chat` model. Each personality has a ~200-word system prompt defining tone, vocabulary, and worldview. Max 100 tokens per message. Falls back to templates on API failure.

### Frontend: BotConfigPanel

VelgSidePanel slide-out with "Bot Deployment Console meets Collectible Card Deck" aesthetic. Three sections:

1. **YOUR DECK** — Saved presets as compact horizontal cards (personality icon + name + difficulty badge + quick-add/delete buttons). Stagger entrance on panel open.
2. **FORGE NEW UNIT** — Creation form: callsign input, 2×2+1 personality card grid (SVG radar charts showing 5-axis stats, personality accent color borders, stagger reveal), 3-segment difficulty toggle (LOW/MED/HGH with morph transition), expandable tactical profile + behavior matrix (CSS horizontal bar chart).
3. **DEPLOY TO EPOCH** — Simulation dropdown (filtered to available templates) + deploy button.

### Frontend: Bot Indicators in Epoch UI

- **EpochLeaderboard:** Bot entries show personality SVG icon + "BOT" badge + difficulty label next to simulation name, color-coded per personality type.
- **EpochBattleLog:** Bot-originated events prefixed with `[BOT]` tag in personality-specific color.
- **EpochChatPanel:** Bot messages styled with amber-tinted background, italic text, "BOT" badge next to sender name.
- **EpochReadyPanel:** Bot participants show amber "BOT" tag next to name.
- **EpochLobbyActions:** "Add Bots" button (creator-only, lobby phase) opens BotConfigPanel.

### AI Settings Integration

Two new settings in the AI Settings panel (`category: 'ai'`):

| Setting | Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| Bot Chat Mode | `bot_chat_mode` | dropdown | `template` | Template (free, instant) vs LLM (rich, API cost) |
| Bot Chat Model | `model_bot_chat` | model selector | `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` | Only visible when mode = LLM |

## Epoch Realtime Chat & Coordination (Migration 037)

Epoch participants need real-time communication channels for diplomacy, coordination, and tactical planning. Migration 037 adds an in-game chat system built on Supabase Realtime Broadcast, with separate channels for public epoch-wide diplomacy and private team-only encrypted communications.

### Database Schema

**`epoch_chat_messages` table:**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | PK, default gen_random_uuid() | Message identifier |
| `epoch_id` | UUID | FK game_epochs, NOT NULL | Parent epoch |
| `sender_id` | UUID | FK auth.users, NOT NULL | Message author |
| `sender_simulation_id` | UUID | FK simulations, NOT NULL | Sender's simulation (for display context) |
| `channel_type` | TEXT | NOT NULL, CHECK ('epoch' or 'team') | Channel scope |
| `team_id` | UUID | FK epoch_teams, NULLABLE | Team channel target (NULL for epoch-wide) |
| `content` | TEXT | NOT NULL, 1-2000 chars | Message body |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | default now() | Timestamp |

**Column addition to `epoch_participants`:**

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cycle_ready` | BOOLEAN | false | Whether participant has signaled ready for next cycle |

**Indexes:**

| Index | Columns | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `idx_epoch_chat_epoch_created` | (epoch_id, created_at) | Cursor-based pagination for epoch-wide messages |
| `idx_epoch_chat_team_created` | (team_id, created_at) | Cursor-based pagination for team messages |

### RLS Policies (4)

| Policy | Operation | Rule |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `epoch_chat_select` | SELECT | Authenticated users can read all epoch-wide messages (`channel_type = 'epoch'`) |
| `epoch_chat_team_select` | SELECT | Team members can read their own team messages (matched via `epoch_participants.team_id`) |
| `epoch_chat_insert` | INSERT | Authenticated users can insert with `sender_id = auth.uid()` |
| `epoch_chat_anon_select` | SELECT | Anon users can read epoch-wide messages (spectator access) |

### Broadcast Triggers (2)

**`broadcast_epoch_chat`** — On INSERT to `epoch_chat_messages`:
- Sends via Supabase Realtime Broadcast to topic `epoch:{epoch_id}:chat` for epoch-wide messages
- Sends to `epoch:{epoch_id}:team:{team_id}:chat` for team messages
- Payload includes sender_id, sender_simulation_id, channel_type, content, created_at

**`broadcast_ready_signal`** — On UPDATE of `cycle_ready` in `epoch_participants`:
- Broadcasts to `epoch:{epoch_id}:status` topic
- Payload includes simulation_id, cycle_ready state
- Enables live ready-state tracking without polling

### Realtime Architecture (4 Channel Types)

All channels use Supabase Realtime with `config: { private: true }` for authenticated access.

| Channel Pattern | Type | Purpose |
|----------------|------|---------|
| `epoch:{id}:chat` | Broadcast | Epoch-wide messages — public diplomacy, announcements, taunts |
| `epoch:{id}:presence` | Presence | Online user tracking via Supabase Presence API — who's watching |
| `epoch:{id}:status` | Broadcast | Ready signals, cycle advancement events, phase transitions |
| `epoch:{id}:team:{tid}:chat` | Broadcast | Team-only messages — alliance coordination, secret planning |

### API Endpoints (4)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/epochs/{epoch_id}/chat` | authenticated | Send message (epoch-wide or team channel) |
| GET | `/api/v1/epochs/{epoch_id}/chat` | optional | List epoch-wide messages (cursor-based pagination) |
| GET | `/api/v1/epochs/{epoch_id}/chat/team/{team_id}` | team member | List team messages (cursor-based pagination) |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/epochs/{epoch_id}/participants/{simulation_id}/ready` | participant | Toggle cycle_ready state |

### Frontend Components

**3 new components + 1 modified:**

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **EpochChatPanel** | `components/epoch/EpochChatPanel.ts` | Dual-channel chat interface with ALL CHANNELS / TEAM FREQ tabs. REST-based message catch-up on mount + Supabase Realtime Broadcast for live incoming messages. Directional message styling (own messages right-aligned, others left-aligned). Simulation name + theme color per sender. |
| **EpochPresenceIndicator** | `components/epoch/EpochPresenceIndicator.ts` | Online user dot indicator per simulation. Subscribes to Presence channel. Green dot = online, dim = offline. Shown in leaderboard and chat sender labels. |
| **EpochReadyPanel** | `components/epoch/EpochReadyPanel.ts` | Cycle ready toggle with live broadcast status display. Shows all participants' ready states in real time. Visual progress bar toward full readiness. |
| **EpochOpsBoard** | `components/epoch/EpochOpsBoard.ts` | Extracted from EpochCommandCenter: dossier cards + collapsible COMMS sidebar. Shows EpochChatPanel for user's active epoch participation. |

### RealtimeService (Platform Service)

Singleton service at `services/realtime/RealtimeService.ts` managing all Supabase Realtime channel subscriptions.

**Preact Signals:**

| Signal | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `onlineUsers` | `Signal<Map<string, PresenceState>>` | Online presence per epoch |
| `epochMessages` | `Signal<ChatMessage[]>` | Epoch-wide message buffer |
| `teamMessages` | `Signal<ChatMessage[]>` | Team message buffer |
| `readyStates` | `Signal<Map<string, boolean>>` | Cycle ready state per simulation |
| `unreadEpochCount` | `Signal<number>` | Unread epoch message count |
| `unreadTeamCount` | `Signal<number>` | Unread team message count |

**Channel Lifecycle:**

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `joinEpoch(epochId)` | Subscribe to chat, presence, and status channels |
| `leaveEpoch()` | Unsubscribe all epoch channels, clear signals |
| `joinTeam(epochId, teamId)` | Subscribe to team chat channel |
| `leaveTeam()` | Unsubscribe team channel, clear team signals |

Unread badge counting uses focus tracking — messages received while the chat panel is not visible increment the unread counter. Focusing the panel resets it to zero.

### Operations Board COMMS Panel

The EpochOpsBoard (extracted from EpochCommandCenter) provides a collapsible COMMS sidebar for in-context communication during tactical operations.

**Layout:**
- Desktop: two-column grid — operative cards on the left, chat panel (360px fixed width) on the right
- Mobile: stacked layout — chat panel below operative cards
- Collapsible via amber glow toggle button with signal strength indicator icon

**Behavior:**
- Auto-discovers user's active epoch participation on mount
- If user is a participant in an active epoch, COMMS panel is available
- Empty state message when user has no active epoch participation
- Signal strength indicator reflects WebSocket connection health (connected / reconnecting / disconnected)

## Epoch Cycle Email Notifications (Migration 044)

Players receive email notifications at key epoch lifecycle moments: cycle resolution, phase transitions, and epoch completion. All emails respect per-user preferences (opt-in/opt-out per type, bilingual EN/DE).

### Notification Types

| Type | Trigger | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Cycle Briefing** | `resolve_cycle()` completes | Per-player fog-of-war compliant briefing: own scores, own missions (successes/failures), detected threats, cycle summary |
| **Phase Change** | `advance_phase()` transitions epoch | New phase name, description of what changes, current standings summary |
| **Epoch Completed** | Epoch reaches `completed` status | Final leaderboard, winner announcement, per-player final scores breakdown |

### Recipient Resolution

`CycleNotificationService._resolve_recipients()` follows this chain:

1. Fetch all `epoch_participants` for the epoch (excluding bots: `is_bot = false`)
2. Load `notification_preferences` for each participant's `user_id`
3. Filter by the relevant preference flag (`cycle_resolved`, `phase_changed`, or `epoch_completed`)
4. Users without a `notification_preferences` row receive defaults (all enabled, locale `'en'`)
5. Batch-resolve emails via `get_user_emails_batch()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (queries `auth.users`)

### Player Briefing (Fog-of-War Compliant)

Cycle briefing emails use `_build_player_briefing()` which only includes data the player should know:

- **Own scores** — all 5 dimensions + composite for current cycle
- **Own missions** — operative deployments with success/failure results (no enemy mission details)
- **Detected threats** — only threats that were detected via counter-intelligence (not all incoming operatives)
- **Cycle number** and **phase** context

### Database

```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id         UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle_resolved  BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    phase_changed   BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    epoch_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    email_locale    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en' CHECK (email_locale IN ('en', 'de')),
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (user_id)
);
```

RLS: authenticated users can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE their own row only (`user_id = auth.uid()`).

### Backend

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **CycleNotificationService** | `services/cycle_notification_service.py` | Recipient resolution, player briefing assembly, email dispatch via Resend API |
| **Email Templates** | `services/email_templates.py` | 3 new render functions (`render_cycle_briefing`, `render_phase_change`, `render_epoch_completed`) — bilingual HTML emails with dark tactical HUD aesthetic |

Integration points in `routers/epochs.py`:
- `resolve_cycle` endpoint calls `send_cycle_notifications()` after cycle resolution
- `advance_phase` endpoint calls `send_phase_change_notifications()` on phase transition, and `send_epoch_completed_notifications()` when advancing to `completed`

All email sends are best-effort (non-blocking `try/except`) — email failures do not block epoch lifecycle.

### Frontend

`NotificationsSettingsPanel` in the Settings view provides 3 toggle switches (Cycle Briefings, Phase Changes, Epoch Completed) and a language selector (English/Deutsch). Uses `NotificationPreferencesApiService` (2 methods: `getPreferences`, `updatePreferences`).

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/users/me/notification-preferences` | Get preferences (returns defaults if no row) |
| POST | `/api/v1/users/me/notification-preferences` | Upsert preferences |
