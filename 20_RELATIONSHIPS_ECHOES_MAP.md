# 20 - Agent Relationships, Event Echoes & The Cartographer's Map

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Phase:** 6 (all tasks complete)

---

## Overview

Three interconnected features that establish the connective tissue between the platform's four simulations:

1. **Agent Relationships** — Intra-simulation social graph. Agents link to each other with typed, weighted, directional relationships that are driven by each simulation's taxonomy.
2. **Event Echoes** — The Bleed mechanic from `concept.md`. High-impact events create AI-transformed echoes in connected simulations, distorted through each world's aesthetic lens.
3. **The Cartographer's Map** — A platform-level network visualization showing all simulations as nodes and their connections as animated edges, rendered as a force-directed SVG graph.

### Lore Context

These features implement core concepts from `concept.md`:

- **The Bleed (Chapter VI)** — Cross-Shard contamination. Events leak between simulations through specific vectors, transformed by the receiving world's narrative voice.
- **The Vectors (Chapter VII)** — Seven channels of transmission: Commerce, Language, Memory, Resonance, Architecture, Dream, Desire.
- **The Tides (Chapter VIII)** — Variable echo intensity. High/low/eddies map to the `echo_strength` and decay mechanics.
- **The Cartographers (Chapter IX)** — "The Bureau maps everything." The Map UI embodies this role.
- **The Gaze (Chapter X)** — "You are performing an act of Cartography when you observe a simulation."

## Feature 1: Agent Relationships

### What It Does

Creates a directed graph of relationships between agents within a simulation. Each relationship has a type (driven by per-simulation taxonomy), intensity (1-10), optional bidirectional flag, and a narrative description.

### Database Schema

**Table: `agent_relationships`**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `simulation_id` | UUID | FK to simulations |
| `source_agent_id` | UUID | FK to agents (relationship origin) |
| `target_agent_id` | UUID | FK to agents (relationship target) |
| `relationship_type` | TEXT | Taxonomy-driven (e.g., "rival", "mentor") |
| `is_bidirectional` | BOOLEAN | Whether the relationship goes both ways |
| `intensity` | INTEGER | 1-10 scale of relationship strength |
| `description` | TEXT | Narrative description |
| `metadata` | JSONB | Extensible (history, origin, etc.) |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-set |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-updated via trigger |

**Constraints:**
- `no_self_relation` — An agent cannot relate to itself
- `unique_relationship` — Unique on (source_agent_id, target_agent_id, relationship_type)

### Relationship Types (Per Simulation)

| Simulation | Types |
|-----------|-------|
| **Velgarien** | handler, informant, rival, co_conspirator, supervisor, subject |
| **Capybara Kingdom** | ally, mentor, rival, trading_partner, blood_oath, scholarly_colleague |
| **Station Null** | crew_partner, antagonist, subject_of_study, commanding_officer, quarantine_contact |
| **Speranza** | contrada_kin, raid_partner, apprentice, rival, salvage_partner, sworn_enemy |

## Feature 2: Event Echoes (The Bleed)

### What It Does

When a high-impact event occurs in one simulation, it can "bleed" into connected simulations as a transformed echo. The echo is distorted through the receiving world's narrative voice and aesthetic, creating a new event that feels native to the target simulation while carrying traces of its origin.

### How Echoes Work

1. **Triggering:** An admin selects a source event and a target simulation, choosing a bleed vector
2. **Echo Record:** A record is created in `event_echoes` with status `pending`
3. **AI Transformation:** The echo service uses the `event_echo_transformation` prompt template to rewrite the event in the target simulation's voice
4. **Target Event:** A new event is created in the target simulation with `data_source = 'bleed'`
5. **Provenance:** The target event's `external_refs` contains the full echo chain

### Echo Vectors

The seven channels through which events bleed between simulations:

| Vector | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Commerce** | Trade, economics, resource flow | A market crash in Velgarien causes supply shortages in Capybara Kingdom |
| **Language** | Words, phrases, propaganda | Bureaucratic terms from Velgarien appear in Station Null comms |
| **Memory** | Collective/individual memory | Station Null crew dream of underground kingdoms |
| **Resonance** | Vibration, frequency, music | Bureau radio frequencies bleed into station transmissions |
| **Architecture** | Built environment, spatial echoes | Brutalist forms appear in Speranza's underground constructions |
| **Dream** | Subconscious, surreal imagery | Citizens dream of dark waters and bioluminescent caverns |
| **Desire** | Wants, needs, emotional pull | A longing for open skies spreads through underground civilizations |

### Cascade Prevention (Multi-Layer)

Echoes can themselves trigger further echoes, creating cascading chains. Multiple safeguards prevent runaway cascades:

1. **Depth limit:** `echo_depth` CHECK constraint limits to 3 hops maximum
2. **Strength decay:** Each hop multiplies strength by the target simulation's `bleed_strength_decay` setting (default 0.6)
3. **Minimum strength:** Echoes below 0.3 strength cannot propagate further
4. **Data source check:** Events with `data_source = 'bleed'` have a higher impact threshold
5. **Unique constraint:** Only one echo per (source_event, target_simulation) pair

### Database Schema

**Table: `event_echoes`**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `source_event_id` | UUID | FK to events (original event) |
| `source_simulation_id` | UUID | FK to simulations (where the event originated) |
| `target_simulation_id` | UUID | FK to simulations (where the echo lands) |
| `target_event_id` | UUID | FK to events (the created echo event, nullable) |
| `echo_vector` | TEXT | One of 7 vectors (commerce, language, etc.) |
| `echo_strength` | NUMERIC(3,2) | 0.0 to 1.0, decays per hop |
| `echo_depth` | INTEGER | 1-3, chain depth |
| `root_event_id` | UUID | Original event in the chain (for cascade tracking) |
| `status` | TEXT | pending, generating, completed, failed, rejected |
| `bleed_metadata` | JSONB | Transformation notes, AI context |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-set |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-updated via trigger |

**Constraints:**
- `no_self_echo` — Source and target simulations must be different
- `unique_echo` — Unique on (source_event_id, target_simulation_id)

### Status Workflow

```
pending --> generating --> completed
   |                         |
   +--------> rejected       +-----> failed
```

- **pending** — Echo record created, awaiting approval or AI transformation
- **generating** — AI is transforming the event text
- **completed** — Echo event created in target simulation
- **failed** — AI transformation or creation failed
- **rejected** — Admin manually rejected the echo

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Role | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/simulations/{id}/echoes` | viewer | List echoes (filter: direction, status) |
| GET | `/api/v1/simulations/{id}/events/{eid}/echoes` | viewer | List echoes from a specific event |
| POST | `/api/v1/simulations/{id}/echoes` | admin | Manually trigger an echo |

### API Examples

**Trigger an echo:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/simulations/{sim_id}/echoes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_event_id": "uuid-of-high-impact-event",

curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/simulations/{sim_id}/echoes/{echo_id}/approve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>"
```

### Echo'd Event Shape

When an echo creates a new event in the target simulation, the event has:

```json
{
  "name": "Spectral Frequencies in the Deep",
  "description": "HAVEN's sensors detected anomalous radio patterns matching classified Bureau transmissions...",
  "data_source": "bleed",
  "impact_level": 6,
  "external_refs": {
    "echo_id": "uuid",
    "source_event_id": "uuid",
    "source_simulation_id": "uuid",
    "root_event_id": "uuid",
    "echo_vector": "resonance",
    "echo_depth": 1
  }
}
```

### UI Components

**EventDetailsPanel — Echoes Section:**
- Accordion section showing outgoing echoes (where this event has echoed to)
- For bleed events: incoming provenance chain showing origin
- Each echo displays: source/target simulation name, vector badge, strength bar, status badge, depth indicator
- "Trigger Echo" button for admins

**EchoCard:**
- Source simulation name/icon, target simulation name/icon
- Vector badge (commerce, language, etc.)
- Strength bar (0-1)
- Status badge (pending/generating/completed/failed/rejected)
- Depth indicator
- Click navigates to target event (if completed)

**EchoTriggerModal (admin+):**
- Target simulation: dropdown (excludes current simulation)
- Echo vector: dropdown with all 7 vectors
- Strength override: slider (0.1-1.0)

**EventCard — Bleed Badge:**
- Events with `data_source === 'bleed'` show a "Bleed" badge (accent color)

**EventsView — Bleed Filter:**
- Checkbox toggle in SharedFilterBar: "Show Bleed events only"
- Filters the event list to only show events that originated from echoes

### Prompt Templates

**`relationship_generation`** — Given an agent's character/background and the other agents in the simulation, generates 2-4 plausible relationships with type, intensity, and description.

**`event_echo_transformation`** — Transforms an event from one world's narrative voice into another's. Input: source event, source world description, target world description, echo vector. Output: new event title and description that feels native to the target world.

## Feature 3: The Cartographer's Map

### What It Does

A platform-level page at `/multiverse` showing all four simulations as nodes in a force-directed graph, connected by animated edges representing their bleed connections. The map provides a visual overview of the multiverse topology and allows navigation to individual simulations.

### Route & Navigation

- **URL:** `/multiverse`
- **Platform-level:** Not scoped to any simulation
- **Navigation:** "Map" / "Karte" link in PlatformHeader (visible on all pages)
- **Default view:** Force-directed SVG graph on desktop, card list on mobile

### Simulation Connections

**Table: `simulation_connections`**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `simulation_a_id` | UUID | FK to simulations |
| `simulation_b_id` | UUID | FK to simulations |
| `connection_type` | TEXT | bleed, trade, rumour, dream |
| `bleed_vectors` | TEXT[] | Which vectors flow on this edge |
| `strength` | NUMERIC(3,2) | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `description` | TEXT | Lore description of the connection |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | Whether the connection is currently active |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-set |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-updated via trigger |

**Seeded Connections (complete graph):**

| Simulation A | Simulation B | Vectors | Strength | Description |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Velgarien | Capybara Kingdom | memory, architecture | 0.7 | Brutalist forms appear in cavern walls; citizens dream of dark waters |
| Velgarien | Station Null | dream, resonance | 0.5 | Bureau radio frequencies bleed into station comms |
| Velgarien | Speranza | commerce, language | 0.6 | Propaganda leaflets found in salvage; similar bureaucratic structures |
| Capybara Kingdom | Station Null | memory, desire | 0.4 | The Unterzee's darkness mirrors the void; bioluminescence echoes station lights |
| Capybara Kingdom | Speranza | architecture, commerce | 0.5 | Underground civilizations share construction knowledge |
| Station Null | Speranza | resonance, dream | 0.6 | Station transmissions reach underground receivers; shared isolation themes |

### Force-Directed Layout Algorithm

The map uses a custom physics simulation (~130 lines) with zero external dependencies:

**Forces:**
1. **Coulomb Repulsion** — `F = 50000 / distance^2` pushes all node pairs apart
2. **Hooke Attraction** — `F = 0.001 * distance * edge_strength` pulls connected nodes together
3. **Center Gravity** — `F = 0.005 * distance_to_center` keeps the graph centered
4. **Damping** — Velocity multiplied by 0.85 each tick for stability

**Parameters (tuned for complete graph of 4 nodes):**

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `repulsion` | 50000 | Strong enough to overcome 6 attraction edges |
| `attraction` | 0.001 | Weak per-edge (cumulative effect of 6 edges is significant) |
| `centerForce` | 0.005 | Gentle centering (repulsion drives structure) |
| `damping` | 0.85 | Prevents oscillation |
| `minDistance` | 140 | Collision avoidance threshold |
| `nodeRadius` | 60 | Visual node size |

**Convergence:** Animation runs via `requestAnimationFrame` until kinetic energy drops below 0.5 or 300 iterations.

### SVG Rendering

**Nodes:**
- Circle with simulation banner image (SVG `<clipPath>` + `<image>`)
- Theme-colored border ring (from `THEME_COLORS` mapping)
- Glow effect matching theme (`<filter>` with `feGaussianBlur`)
- Label below: simulation name (uppercase, monospace)
- Stats: agent count / building count / event count

**Edges:**
- Bezier curves between nodes (quadratic with perpendicular offset)
- Dashed stroke with CSS animation (flowing toward target)
- Stroke color from source node's theme
- Width proportional to connection strength

**Interactions:**
- Click node: navigate to `/simulations/{id}/lore`
- Click edge: open MapConnectionPanel (side panel with connection details)
- Hover node: MapTooltip with description and stats
- Pan: drag background (SVG viewBox manipulation)
- Zoom: scroll wheel (0.5x to 3x range)

### Dark Theme Override

The map is a platform-level view (not inside a simulation shell), so it doesn't inherit per-simulation theme presets. The global CSS tokens define a **light theme** (`--color-surface: #ffffff`). To ensure the map always renders with a dark space-themed appearance, `CartographerMap` overrides CSS custom properties on its `:host`:

```css
:host {
  --color-surface: #0a0a0a;
  --color-surface-raised: #161616;
  --color-text-primary: #f0f0f0;
  --color-text-muted: #777777;
  --color-border: #2a2a2a;
}
```

These cascade through shadow DOM to `MapGraph`, `MapTooltip`, and `MapConnectionPanel`.

### Navigation Toggle

The "Map" / "Karte" nav link in `PlatformHeader` toggles — clicking it while on `/multiverse` navigates back to `/dashboard`. An active state (`header__nav-link--active`) highlights the link when on the map page.

### Responsive Design

| Viewport | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| >768px | Full SVG force graph with pan/zoom |
| <=768px | Vertical card list with simulation name, stats, and theme color indicator |

### Cross-Simulation Writes

Echo creation requires writing to a different simulation's events table, which bypasses standard RLS (user JWT is scoped to source simulation). The echo service uses `get_admin_supabase()` (service-role client) for these cross-simulation writes, with full audit logging.

### E2E Testing Notes

- **Shadow DOM clicks:** Agent card clicks must target `.card__body` (not the host element) to avoid avatar lightbox interception
- **Event card clicks:** Must target `.card__title` for the same reason
- **Map node clicks:** Require `force: true` because banner `<image>` elements intercept pointer events
- **Hidden modal text:** `EchoTriggerModal` is always in the DOM; use `button:visible` locator instead of `getByText`

## i18n

59 new translation strings added for all three features (1088 total). All translated via DeepL API.

Key translation decisions:
- "Bleed" kept as-is in German (established larp/game design terminology)
- "Echo" becomes "Echo" (same in German)
- "The Cartographer's Map" becomes "Die Karte des Kartographen"
- Relationship types use simulation-specific German translations
- Vector names translated: Commerce=Handel, Language=Sprache, Memory=Erinnerung, Resonance=Resonanz, Architecture=Architektur, Dream=Traum, Desire=Verlangen

## Migration

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20260228000000_026_agent_relationships_and_echoes.sql`

Contains:
1. Three CREATE TABLE statements with all constraints and indexes
2. Eight RLS policies (anon SELECT, auth CRUD)
3. Three updated_at triggers
4. 24 taxonomy seed values (relationship types)
5. 12 demo relationships (3 per simulation)
6. 6 simulation connections (complete graph)
7. 2 prompt templates (relationship_generation, event_echo_transformation)

### Deployment Checklist

```bash
# 1. Push migration to production
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_... supabase db push

# 2. Verify tables exist
curl -s "https://bffjoupddfjaljqrwqck.supabase.co/rest/v1/agent_relationships?select=count" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sb_secret_..." \
  -H "apikey: sb_secret_..."

# 3. Deploy code (Railway auto-deploys on git push)
git push origin main

# 4. Verify endpoints
curl -s https://metaverse.center/api/v1/public/map-data | jq '.data.connections | length'
# Expected: 6

curl -s https://metaverse.center/api/v1/public/simulations/{sim_id}/relationships | jq '.data | length'
# Expected: 3 (per simulation)
```
